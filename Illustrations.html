        <p>Welcome to the Character Design section of The Last Flicker. Here, we explore the creative process behind bringing our characters—Josh, Amilia, and Dav to life. From initial sketches to final renderings, discover how each design choice reflects their personalities and roles within the story.</p>

        <div class="section-josh">
            <div class="text-content">
                <h2>Josh</h2>
                <p>Josh is the adventurous spirit of the group, whose curiosity sets the events of the story in motion.</p>
                <p>Early designs portrayed Josh with an energetic posture and casual attire, emphasizing his laid-back yet daring nature.</p>
                <p>We experimented with different hairstyles and accessories to capture his bold personality, eventually settling on a look that balances approachability with a hint of recklessness.</p>
                <p>Josh's final design features a confident stance and a mischievous smile, reflecting his role as the instigator of the group's adventure.</p>

        <div class="section-amilia">
            <div class="text-content">
                <h2>Amilia</h2>
                <p> Amilia is the skeptical yet caring member of the trio, often serving as the voice of reason.</p>
                <p>Amilia's early designs focused on a reserved demeanor, with elements that hinted at her analytical mind.</p>
                <p>In refining her design, we added subtle details like a book or a smartphone to symbolize her resourcefulness and intellect.</p>
                <p>Her final look combines practicality with subtle elegance, showcasing her grounded nature and inner strength.</p>
                <p>We wanted Amilia's design to reflect her skepticism and caution, so we opted for a more muted color palette and thoughtful expressions.</p>

        <div class="section-dave">
            <div class="text-content">
                <h2>Dave</h2>
                <p> Dav is the reluctant hero, whose ancestral ties to the haunted church become central to the story.</p>
                <p>Initial sketches depicted Dav as an average, unassuming individual, highlighting his unawareness of his family's past.</p>
                <p>As we delved into his backstory, we incorporated ancestral symbols subtly into his clothing design.</p>
                <p>The final design showcases Dav with a modest appearance, but with intricate patterns on his accessories that hint at his heritage.</p>
                <p>Balancing Dav's ordinary exterior with the extraordinary role he plays required careful attention to detail in his design elements.</p>
